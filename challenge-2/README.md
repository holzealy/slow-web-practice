# Challenge 2

In this challenge, you will practice writing valid HTML to semantically annotate the web page you created in Challenge 1, making sure that the markup enables **all** users to effectively navigate the information on the page.


## Accessibility Checklist

1. Do headings form an outline of the page content?
2. Are common regions of the web page properly identified? (e.g. as banner, main content, or navigation?)
    - There are two methods used for explicitly identifying common page regions: HTML5 semantic elements and ARIA landmark roles. You should utilize both for the purpose of this challenge. 
3. Do images have alternative text?
4. Is there sufficient contrast between text color and background color?
5. Does the content scale well when text is enlarged?
6. Is content accessible on mobile devices?
7. Can all menus, links, buttons, and other controls be operated by keyboard, to make them accesible for users that are unable to use a mouse?
